At the gym this afternoon, I was entering the female changing room just as a man was leaving it. I did a double take; the man apologised, explaining that he'd taken a wrong turn. I said OK, and went about my way.

It's probably true. People take wrong turns all the time. It was also around 2 p.m., with many members walking around, it didn't seem like an ideal time to try anything. Still, before I peed, I realised I HAD to check the cubicle for recording devices. Just last week, [a man was convicted of videoing women showering at the gym he worked at](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-gym-employee-pleads-guilty-to-taking-voyeuristic-videos-of-women-showering-in-gym). In 2024, there were [519 reported voyeurism cases (including upskirt) in Singapore](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/police-physical-crime-statistics-2024-shop-theft-voyeurism-4937926). 

I thought about questioning the man. Ask him how long he was in there for, if he was a regular here, could he really have taken a wrong turn? I might have been able to say these things when he first apologised, but it seemed weirdly belated _now_, if I had to look around the gym to track him down, then ask him questions that wouldn't achieve anything.

I reported the incident to a staff member later, who didn't seem at all fazed and coolly responded with "thank you for letting me know". See something, say something. I am absolved.

## It isn't a crime for a man to enter female bath or changing rooms

The only time I used a male bathroom was many years ago at a co-working space. The female toilets were under maintenance, and I was allowed to use the men's. It was quite exciting for me because I had never been beforeâ€”my first visit to the male toilet! Yippee! I entered the bathroom, normal so far; I don't remember if it reeks of pee or anything like that. I proceeded to a cubicle, pushed the door open, and saw a literal pile of shit on the seat of the toilet bowl. ðŸ’© I returned to my office, horrified, asked my male co-worker if this was normal for men's toilets. He said absolutely not.
