I was introduced to Emotiguy through a [Telegram sticker pack](https://t.me/addstickers/bttvffz) back in 2022. I was immediately obsessed.

I especially love this one where he's smiling with all his teeth, eyes closed, and a palm over his left eye. His expression conveys a certain kind of lightness and glee that I've never seen any emoticon capture before.

Emotiguy is a [Daz3D](https://www.daz3d.com/emoticon-poses) character. (Daz3D is 3D‑content platform + software for creating and rendering 3D scenes.)

You might also know him as:
- Joe
- Picardia
- Thumbs Up Emoji Man
- Yellow M&M

A few weeks ago I discovered this YouTube video, [How to make EmotiGuy / Joe Memes in Blender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuGi_knr70k) by a fellow Emotiguy enthusiast, [Liam](https://duckwithsunglasses.com/portfolio/). I absorbed his tutorial and got to work immediately. 


I'm lucky to have a bit of Blender experience from my brief infatuation with making 3D models (driven largely by the desire to get my money's worth from my M1 MacBook Pro purchase in late 2021).

Thrilled that I'm contributing to the Corpus!
