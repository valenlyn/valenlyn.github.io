I'd been very happy for a very long time, so it was strange when I woke up one day after another feeling completely BORED.

I felt awful in June, but it didn't reflect until a month later because I was too much in the habit of saying "I’m great!" by default. It took a while to realize my baseline had shifted and start logging how I actually felt. It was also difficult to realise that I wasn't feeling very good—I wasn't experiencing any pain or hardship, and I still felt an immense gratitude for my life each day!

What do you mean it's not enough that I eat plenty of nutritious foods, sleep eight to ten hours every night, visit the gym three times a week, am surrounded by people I love, and (very likely) experience less stress than 99% of people?? What more could I possibly want???

_(novelty. meaning. purpose. transcendence. glory. greatness...)_

Shut up, Mill! You're so right.

When I had a 9-5 some years ago, I bought TOTO twice a week. I had always understood that my life wouldn't fundamentally change by a windfall; I would quit my job and have some fun buying a few nice things and see some nice places, but I would be stuck with the problem I've been putting off all my life, a problem that would persist whether I had ten, fifty, or a hundred million dollars:

**`WHAT IS MY FUNCTION IN LIFE?`**

God! I'm so envious of the ones who know innately what it is they're meant to do. I have never known. In primary four, we were asked to write about our dream. I naively described wanting a pet crocodile. My teacher called my mom to complain.

It isn't clear that my finding of purpose would dissolve my ennui, since plenty of people with clear purpose still go through slumps. So I'm not convinced that I _have_ to solve the problem right now, because I might wake up tomorrow and be my usual jolly self again. Finding one's purpose can appear like a panacea for people without purpose.

What I care about most right now is not feeling this way, and by that, I mean actually feeling joy completing projects, looking forward to things, not just checking off old to-do and bucket lists.

I wonder if I stopped doing things altogether, I’d stop noticing how little joy I’m getting from them. Maybe this sense of _blargle_ only exists because I keep trying. Not doing could do something! Especially after spending the past month doing all the things I thought I wanted, and feeling mostly nothing.

I shall report back.
